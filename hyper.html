    <h1>HELLO WORLD!</h1>
    <p>The Guinness Book of <span1>World</span1> Records has a <span2>world</span2> record for text messaging, currently held by Sonja Kristiansen of Norway. Kristiansen keyed in the official text message, as established by Guinness, in 37.28 seconds.[188] The message is, "The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the <span3>world</span3>. In reality, they seldom attack a human."[188] In 2005, the record was held by a 24-year-old Scottish man, Craig Crosbie, who completed the same message in 48 seconds, beating the previous time by 19 seconds.[189] The Book of Alternative Records lists Chris Young of Salem, Oregon as the <span4>world</span4>-record holder for the fastest 160-character text message where the contents of the message are not provided ahead of time. His record of 62.3 seconds was set on 23 May 2007.[190]
        Elliot Nicholls of Dunedin, New Zealand currently holds the <span5>world</span5> record for the fastest blindfolded text messaging. A record of a 160-letter text in 45 seconds while blindfolded was set on 17 November 2007, beating the old record of 1-minute 26 seconds set by an Italian in September 2006.[191] Andrew Acklin of Ohio is credited with the <span6>world</span6> record for most text messages sent or received in a single month, with 200,052. His accomplishments were first in the <span7>World</span7> Records Academy and later followed up by Ripley's Believe It Or Not 2010: Seeing Is Believing. He has been acknowledged by The Universal Records Database for the most text messages in a single month; however, this has since been broken twice and as of 2010 was listed as 566607 messages by Fred Lindgren.[192]
        In January 2010, LG Electronics sponsored an international competition, the LG Mobile <span8>World</span8> Cup, to determine the fastest pair of texters. The winners were a team from South Korea, Ha Mok-min and Bae Yeong-ho.[193] On 6 April 2011, SKH Apps released an iPhone app, iTextFast, to allow consumers to test their texting speed and practice the paragraph used by Guinness Book of <span9>World</span9> Records. As of 2011, best time listed on Game Center for that paragraph is 34.65 seconds.[194]</p>
